<h1>About me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Hi! I'm a web developer and I love all things tech. 
    When I'm not knee-deep in code, I'm probably reading up on the latest development trends or practicing my sketching(or both).</p>

<p>I got my start in technology as a self-taught coder, and since then I've never looked back.
    I specialize in front-end development,but I have a little bit of experience with everything from coding to QA to project management.</p>

<p>I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities , and I'm excited to see what the future holds for me in the world of tech.
     Thanks for reading!</p>
